This is `Hey World, hello!` in all languages I can remember to have built working software, either for production,
prototyping or academic projects.

### Javascript
Starting with Javascript (and its relatives), the one I've spent about 6 years of my live working with and I still got mixed
feelings as the language it self is far far from perfect but it's improving quite well since ES6 release:
```javascript noLineNumbers
console.log('Hey World, hello!')
```

### PHP
The first language I used for dynamic web pages, it was on version PHP4 back then. Later I've used it for production level
applications using Yii and CodeIgniter MVC frameworks.
```noLineNumbers
<?php echo "Hey World, hello!"; ?>
```

### Bash
UNIX shell script is such a powerful tool, invest time improving bash skills, it will worth it.
```bash noLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hey World, hello!"
```

### Lua
Means *Moon* in Portuguese. A powerful, lightweight scripting language widelly used in gaming platforms. Ive used to develop an mobile game using
Corona SDK (2D game engine):
```noLineNumbers
print("Hey World, hello!")
```

### BrightScript
Proprietary scripting language to build *channels* for Roku TV streaming platforms. You need to build nearly everything
from scratch as community (and open-source libs) basically don't exit.
```
? "Hey World, hello!"
```

### C
I used **C** in academic projects for example to build a simple chat with Socket-based IPC (InterProcess Communication)
```noLineNumbers
printf("Hey %s, %s!", "World", "hello");
```

### Java
Everybody knows a little bit of JAVA, right? I'm more into functional programming although well designed OOP application
making use of design patterns and good practises has its place in my heart.
```java noLineNumbers
System.out.println("Hey World, hello!");
```

### C#
Only used in academic projects, what I've said in Java fist here as well. Note in OOP, this line goes in a class method:
```noLineNumbers
Console.WriteLine("Hey World, hello!");
```

### Assembly (8051 Architecture)
This is the funny on.. During my academic path I had to code running programs for AT80S51 microcontroller, you need to be
careful or you might mistake a `R0` by `RO` as I did (and took me nearly 3 days to figure it out). Obviously
I can't code it anymore but here is an example I took from [here](http://www.8051projects.info/lcd3.php):
```
LCALL INIT_LCD
LCALL CLEAR_LCD
MOV A,#'H'
LCALL WRITE_TEXT
MOV A,#'E'
LCALL WRITE_TEXT
MOV A,#'Y'
LCALL WRITE_TEXT
...
```

### Wolfram Mathematica
Similar to MatLab, this software is very powerful when it comes to applied science and mathematics. I've used it obviously
in academic environment.
```noLineNumbers
Print["Hey World, hello!"]
```

### VisualBasic
This is a classic! Used to play with it when in high school to build simple UI apps and impress my friends :D
```noLineNumbers
MsgBox "Hey World, hello!"
```

I've played with other languages like **Go**, **Dart** and **Rust** but never built something cool with it.
