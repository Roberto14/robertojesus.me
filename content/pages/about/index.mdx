### Biography

I am a Software Engineer focused on **web development**, code maintenance and **DevOps** culture.
I did my education on Informatics Engineering which is some sort of Computer Science in Madeira's University.

I've been exploring the web since the beginning. My first application was in fact a website back in 2005.
Later in my master thesis I explored the world of **web advertising** and monetising web platforms.

Right after I finished university I tried to build a business with other 2 colleagues after winning an entrepreneurship
challenge. The product was called ServicePoint but it didn't succeed after 1 year and half of development.
We built a mobile **webapp** backed with a
resilient **NodeJS** API.

Since then I've worked with Roku channels (applications) using BrightScript, more NodeJS APIs and ReactJS frontend applications.

### Other than work

I love sports, mostly football and a couple more. I support the portuguese team **Sporting Lisbon**.
Hang out with friends and enjoy a **cold beer** having a good laugh is something precious for me :)
And last but not least, I also enjoy **travelling**! Who doesn't? To meet new people, cultures and languages are definitely one
of my fav hobbies.
