Recently I read a very good article¹ published by a co-worker which demonstrate how to apply
SOLID principles on react applications.
In the article, the Open-closed principle is demonstrated using composition which I believe
to be the *de facto*, and the best method to extend React components, although the principle
usually refers to classical inheritance².

So I decided to write this article to exemplify how to apply the Open-closed principle
using both **inheritance** and **composition**.

As a naive example let's create a simple `Button` component that gets a single prop `name`.
A new component, `SmileyButton` should extend the previous and get a new prop `smiley`.
This prop will be concatenated to the button's name.

If to be compliant with the Open-closed principle, it required to use class-based inheritance,
this is how we could design our example:

```javascript
class Button extends React.Component {
  getButtonText() {
    return this.props.name;
  }

  render() {
    return <button>{this.getButtonText()}</button>;
  }
}

// Note that SmileyButton extends Button instead of React.Component
class SmileyButton extends Button {
  getButtonText() {
    const text = super.getButtonText();
    const smiley = this.props.smiley || "";
    return `${text} ${smiley}`;
  }
}

// Client code
const HappyButton = <SmileyButton name="Happy Button" smiley=":D" />
```
The principle is properly applied as we didn't modify the original `Button` component and still
added a custom behaviour!

What about using **composition**? Composition is about _what it does_ over _what it is_ as in inheritance.
Saying that, let's create functional components and compose them to achieve the same result as before:

```javascript
const Button = ({ name }) => <button>{name}</button>

const SmileyButton = ({ name, smiley = "" }) => {
  const happyName = `${name} ${smiley}`;
  return <Button name={happyName} />;
};

// Client code
const HappyButton = <SmileyButton name="Happy Button" smiley=":D" />
```

We achieved the same result as the previous example! We just composed the `Button`
component with the custom behaviour that we need! In my opinion, composition is
more flexible, clean and future proof than inheritance, and joining it with react functional
components... Damn, it's beautiful!

Note **composition** is not exclusive of Functional Programing paradigm,
it's often recommended using it over inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming.

We aren't finished yet! There is another way of extending a component behaviour by
taking a _functional_ approach again. This time original `Button` will provide an API that
lets us change its own behaviour:

```javascript
const Button = ({ getButtonText = () => "" }) =>
    <button>{getButtonText()}</button>

// Client code
const HappyButton = <Button getButtonText={() => "Happy Button :D"} />
```

In this last example, we don't need to compose the button component as the client
will provide the behaviour right away.

Here is a sandbox with working samples for all examples provided above:

        sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

Wrapping up, the composition is the way to go when extending functionality of
React components, and guess what, High Order Components (HOCs) are a perfect example of
composition. Other than that, remember that React class components are deprecated
and will fade away soon! Leave a comment bellow and share your feedback!
