### Biography

I am a Software Engineer focused on **web development**, code maintenance and **DevOps** culture.
I have a B.Sc. on Informatics Engineering (Computer Science) by _Universidade da Madeira_ where I had the opportunity
to explore computer science from computing theory to some electronics and software engineering. Right after,
I continued my education with a M.Sc. degree to consolidate my knowledge in the area.
My master's thesis was based on an internship and approaches the **web advertising** / monetising web platforms,
and the maturity level of a company.

About the Web, I've been exploring it since the 2005 when I first built a very basic website. It was in fact my first application!
Later in 2013, I tried to launch a product with other 2 colleagues after winning an entrepreneurship challenge.
The product was called _ServicePoint_ and it was a mobile **webapp** backed with a **NodeJS** API
that allowed bars / restaurants / hotels customers to order with their own smartphone.
The product didn't succeed after 1y and half of business development.

Since then, I've worked with Roku channels (applications) using BrightScript, NodeJS APIs and ReactJS frontend applications.

Recently I joined the digital nomad world and have been travelling while working remotely as a Senior Frontend Engineer.

### Other than work

When not at work I am loving my partner, reading about new tech, doing some sports,
travelling or enjoying a cold beer on a quiz night game with friends.
