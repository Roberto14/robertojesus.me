title: About
---

I am a Software Engineer focused on **web development**, code maintenance and **DevOps** culture.
I did my education on Informatics Engineering which is some sort of Computer Science in Madeira's University.

I've been exploring the web since the beginning. My first application was in fact a website back in 2005.
Later in my master thesis I explored the world of **web advertising** and monetising web platforms.

Right after I finished university I tried to build a business with other 2 colleagues after winning an entrepreneurship
challenge. The product didn't succeed after 1 year and half of development. We built a mobile **webapp** backed with a
resilient **NodeJS** API.

Since then I've worked with Roku channels (applications) using BrightScript, more NodeJS APIs and ReactJS frontend applications.

### Experienced with:

* **Javascript** environment (ECMAScript standards)
* **NodeJS** applications and SSR (Server side rendering)
* **ReactJS** for frontend applications
* **CI/CD** pipelines and 1-click deployment
* NoSQL databases like **MongoDB**
* **UX** thinking to get the best user journey
* *Functional Programming* with Javascript
* Agile Methods and **Scrum**

## Other than work

When going home after work I like to do **sports** like playing football, squash or going to the gym.

Going out with friends for dinner or just a **beer** is very important to me to keep my balance and relax.

And last but not least, I enjoy **travelling** as well! Who doesn't? To meet new people, cultures and languages are definitely one
of my favourites hobbies.
