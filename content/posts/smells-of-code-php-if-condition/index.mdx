import SequenceNavigation from '../../../src/components/SequenceNavigation'
import sequence from '../smells-of-code/sequence'

<p>
This my first code smell, a basic one. A friend asks me to have a look and integrate a 3rd-party service on his
PHP website. He initially hired a freelance developer through a freelance platform to build his website but we all know
the costs of maintenance. I found some good things like well design SQL queries but the website architecture was very bad.
This code block was funny though ðŸ˜„
</p>

```
if (strpos($key, "contact-form-") === false) {
}
else {
  ...
}
```

<p>I think you should switch the if condition..</p>

```
if (strpos($key, "contact-form-")) {
   ...
}
```
