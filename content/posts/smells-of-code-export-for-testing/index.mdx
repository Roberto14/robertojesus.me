On the Series of Smells of Code, I bring you a topic which is many times
unnoticed or neglected by developers in a daily basis, and I truly believe
most of us have done or still do this **pattern** on daily work.

The **pattern** I'm referring to is just the export of a function for unit testing
purposes. Usually if you export a function from your module api just for testing,
something is already wrong and eventually smelling.

### Why is it wrong?
Ideally your module (component, unit, file, ...) will export
a set of functions or methods that represent its signature or public API. The first problem
occurs right here, when exporting a private member of the module to be easily unit tested
, you are turning this private method into a public one right away. This method can then be used
by the client in ways you haven't thought of. It clearly rises
security concerns and your module will be more prone to errors regardless of
this former private method being unit tested.

//todo set right pattern references

### What alternatives do I have?
First and from now on, I'm going to call this practise an anti-pattern since it violates
the rules of patterns (//todo: set rigth pattern).
There is also no silver bullet or a single **pattern** or way to fix this **anti-pattern**.
Each use case is unique and has its owns business requirements and complexity. Nevetheless,
the aim for refactoring should be focused on Single Responsibility Principle (SRT) and
//todo: patterns set before

All units of a modular system must do a single job only, and do it right!

### How do I refactor the anti-pattern?
As rule of thumb, when I face such need of exporting a private function just to
make my life easier on testing it, I ask myself the following questions:

##### 1. Can I cover my private function only consuming my public api?
Assuming it belongs to this module, providing distinct inputs to my module's public api?

##### 2. Does this function really belongs to this module?
If I can't cover the private function, Should it belong to somewhere
else or even become a module itself (on more complex use cases)?
I can be the client of this module.

##### 3. Can this function be public?
Does it provide useful functionality and is it safe to be public?

##### 4. Should I consider to use rewire technique?
Using rewire technique if I still need to export a private function or just go back and start from 1.

I hope my mental model to get rid of this anti-pattern helps you too. Please tweet
me and share your feedback so that we can learn together.

```
if (strpos($key, "contact-form-") === false) {
}
else {
  ...
}
```

<p>For readability I think you should switch the if condition..</p>

```
if (strpos($key, "contact-form-") !== false) {
   ...
}
```
